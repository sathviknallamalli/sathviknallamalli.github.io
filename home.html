          <hserv class="section-subheading">Accuracy Accounting is a leading local public accounting and business advisory firm based in Seattle, Washington. We are ranked among the top 10 largest CPA firms in the Puget Sound region, with close to
            200
            professionals and support staff.<br />
            <br />
            We serve clients in many industries including dealerships, nonprofit, real estate, construction, hospitality, financial services, technology, life sciences and professional services – providing assurance, tax, business valuations and
            litigation support services. For over 65 years, Accuracy has helped clients maximize their value. Our values of integrity, respect, commitment, and expertise are key to a successful client relationship and relevant in all
            aspects of our business.<br />
            <br />
            Decisions are made at the local level, so clients never have to wait for an answer from a remote city with no direct involvement with their account. This type of client commitment means faster response to the problems you are facing and
            more direct investment in the success of your organization.<br />
            <br />
            Our clients include small, closely held companies and partnerships, nonprofits, and small-middle market public companies with revenues exceeding $350 million operating in many states. These companies have realized the benefit of working
            with a local firm that shares their values, is responsive to their needs, and has the depth of experience and resources that will help them grow.
            <br />
            <br />
            As part of Moore Stephens International Limited, Accuracy provides clients access to resources and professionals in 624 locations across 101 countries. Together, the firms of Moore Stephens International Limited make up one of
            the largest CPA associations in the world and provide resources and expertise comparable to the Big 4 firms.</hserv>

          <hserv class="section-subheading">Accuracy Accounting was founded in 2016 and since that time has grown into the largest CPA firm in the area. We are an assertive firm providing our clients a full range of services.

            Our offices are located in the Intermountain West because this is where we choose to live. However, we serve a wide variety of clients located throughout the United States.

            Because our firm is smaller than the national CPA firms, we maintain close and open relationships with each of our clients. Our commitment is to provide the highest quality services while retaining a small-town atmosphere.

            Accuracy Accounting is a member of the Private Companies Practice Section of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and is active in the local State Societies of CPAs.
            <br />

            <h9 class="section-heading">Professionalism</h9>
            <br />
            <br />
            Our firm is one of the leading firms in the area. By combining our expertise, experience and the energy of our staff, each client receives close personal and professional attention.

            Our high standards, service and specialized staff spell the difference between our outstanding performance, and other firms. We make sure that every client is served by the expertise of our whole firm.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h9 class="section-heading">Responsiveness</h9>
            <br />
            <br />
            Our firm is responsive. Companies who choose our firm rely on competent advice and fast, accurate personnel. We provide total financial services to individuals, large and small businesses and other agencies.

            To see a listing of our services, please take a moment and look at our services page. Because we get new business from the people who know us best, client referrals have fueled our growth in the recent years.

            Through hard work, we have earned the respect of the business and financial communities. This respect illustrates our diverse talents, dedication and ability to respond quickly.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h9 class="section-heading">Quality</h9>
            <br />
            <br />
            An accounting firm is known for the quality of its service. Our firm's reputation reflects the high standards we demand of ourselves.

            Our primary goal as a trusted advisor is to be available to provide insightful advice to enable our clients to make informed financial decisions. We do not accept anything less from ourselves and this is what we deliver to you.

            We feel it is extremely important to continually professionally educate ourselves to improve our technical expertise, financial knowledge and service to our clients.

            Our high service quality and "raving fan" clients are the result of our commitment to excellence.

            We will answer all of your questions, as they impact both your tax and financial situations. We welcome you to contact us anytime.

          In addition, they must meet strict continuing education requirements, undergo peer review, and adhere to a stringent set of ethical standards.

              margin-top: 30px;
              margin-bottom: 50px;
          ">The IRS estimates that it can take 28 ½ hours to research tax law, organize your records, and complete a standard 1040
          return with three common schedules. Tax law is constantly changing, so it is important that you are educated about these changes so you correctly fill out your forms. Being technologically savvy is also important as tax preparation
          software can help eliminate errors, both mathematical and technical. If you’re not comfortable with using this type of software, you may want to contact a CPA.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’re a salaried employee who takes the standard deduction, your return is likely to be simple. However, if you’ve encountered a major life change, such as marriage or divorce, or own a vacation home or rental property, your tax
          situation may be more complicated. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are more likely to be audited by the IRS, and working with a CPA will help lessen that risk. In addition, if you have a high income, live in a state
          with high income taxes, or have a lot of miscellaneous itemized deductions, you could be subjected to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT, which eliminates many itemized deductions and was created to ensure that the wealthy pay
          their share of taxes, is now affecting more middle-class taxpayers. If you think this might affect you, consult a CPA.</h3>

          requires discrepancy be resolve anytime within this seven year window. The IRS and the states will audit within the seven year window. Keep all federal, state and local returns indefinitely and the all supporting documents for seven (7)
          years. Real Estate and stock market transactions records should be kept. Tax consequences of a transaction can depend on events that happened years earlier. Taxpayers often keep files in a single, easily accessible location. Consider
          keeping your files in a safe deposit box or other safe place outside your home.</h3>

              margin-bottom: 50px;
          ">Can an accountant help a new business owner? Remember, the issue to be address is “What level of professional do I need at
          any particular point in time?” An accountant has some advantages. Accountants are unlicensed, this translates into lesser fees. This also translates into a lesser level of professional service. Routine accounting work is appropriate for an
          accountant. The IRS restricts accountants’ ability to represent taxpayers. CPAs and accountants often work in tandem. Accountants will perform the accounting work to the point where a CPA can address the more complex issues. Having
          accountants do pre-CPA level work saves money.
          <br />
          <br />
          You need a CPA when: the IRS wants you for any reason, your professional needs are complicated, bankers or whoever needs financial statements and when your accountant does not understand and/or cannot explain the issues. Non-CPA prepared
          business reports are not considered to be financial statements and have limited third party acceptance. Most importantly you need a CPA BEFORE the circumstances above occur. Establish a relationship with a CPA early in your business
          formation, or now if you are already a business, so that he can give you guidance and keep you away from the pitfalls.</h3>

">What steps can I take to improve my business cash flow?</hr>




          <h3 class="section-subheading" style="
              margin-top: 30px;
              margin-bottom: 50px;
          ">To achieve a positive cash flow, you must have a sound plan. Your business can increase cash reserves in a number of
            ways:
            <br />
            <br />
            Collecting receivables:
            <br />
            <br />Actively manage accounts receivable and quickly collect overdue accounts. Revenues are lost when a firm’s collection policies are not aggressive.
            Tightening credit requirements:
            <br />
            <br />As credit and terms become more stringent, more customers must pay cash for their purchases, thereby increasing the cash on hand and reducing the bad-debt expense. While tightening credit is helpful in the short run, it may not be
            advantageous in the long run. Looser credit allows more customers the opportunity to purchase your products or services.
            Manipulating price of products:
            <br />
            <br />Many small businesses fail to make a profit because they erroneously price their products or services. Before setting your prices, you must understand your product’s market, distribution costs, and competition. Monitor all factors
            that affect pricing on a regular basis and adjust as necessary.
            Taking out short-term loans:
            <br />
            <br />Loans from various financial institutions are often necessary for covering short-term cash-flow problems. Revolving credit lines and equity loans are common types of credit used in this situation.
            Increasing your sales:
            <br />
            <br />Increased sales would appear to increase cash flow. However, if large portions of your sales are made on credit, when sales increase, your accounts receivable increase, not your cash. Meanwhile, inventory is depleted and must be
            replaced. Because receivables usually will not be collected until 30 days after sales, a substantial increase in sales can quickly deplete your firm’s cash reserves.

                  The changing domestic and international tax landscape makes it more difficult than ever to implement an effective long-term tax strategy. A large number of constantly changing variables must be continuously scrutinized to ensure
                  you’re getting the best advice. It’s essential to have a seasoned tax team working for you with the practical experience to quickly understand how legislative and regulatory changes will impact your immediate and long-term
                  situation.

                  Accuracy’s deep bench of tax experts represents a rare concentration of talent unmatched by other local Seattle accounting firms. Our partners and senior professionals work on your behalf, staying on top of the significant
                  tax changes to ensure your tax plan continues to minimize liabilities, maximize profits and preserve wealth.</p>
