            financial statements. And, for 65 years, Accuracy has done exactly that. As accounting standards and governmental regulations have grown more complex, we have multiplied our expertise to help you meet these challenges, while
            still maintaining the integrity and independence needed to protect the public interest.

            As a large, local firm, we can make decisions here and now, without waiting for a national office to call the shots. The result is quick turnarounds, attentive service, and follow-through you can count on.</h3>

  ">Our assurance team focuses on delivering the right level of assurance when conducting compilations and reviews. We work closely with our clients
            to present financial statements that offer the appropriate level of credibility for creditors, vendors, lenders and other important business partners. The result is a financial statement review/compilation report issued in accordance
            with the Statement on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Most importantly, the concerns and needs of your business partners will be satisfied, allowing you to
            move the business forward.

            </br></br>

            Reviews
            Accuracy’s financial statement review service evaluates your company’s financial statements using inquiries, analytical procedures, and knowledge of your business practices and industry. While the scope of the engagement is less
            intrusive than an audit, the resulting report provides a limited level of assurance that no material modifications need to be made to the financial statement.

            </br></br>
            Compilations
            Our financial statement compilation service compiles financial data from your accounting records to present it in the form of financial statements. In a compilation, we do not express any opinion of the accuracy of information in the
            statements. While a compilation is less intensive than a review, companies benefit from having their financial statements presented by an external CPA.

  ">Cybersecurity attacks threaten your business. As cloud computing, mobile devices, and big data become increasingly present in and vital to your
              organization, the threats grow. In this day and age, all companies – regardless of size or industry – need to think seriously about cybersecurity and what they are doing to protect themselves and their customers.
              </br></br>
              For most organizations, information is the most important asset. Many companies, large and small, are adopting the mindset that it’s not if, but when, a cybersecurity attack and data breach will occur. With these threats in mind,
              prevention is critical. So is having detection, response, and recovery processes in place before your organization’s or your clients’ information is compromised, so you can get back to business following a breach.
              </br></br>
              As a partner to hundreds of small and mid-sized organizations, Accuracy has developed a wide range of cost-effective services to help business leaders combat ever-expanding threats and successfully guard their corporate

">Many business owners are involved in a sale, merger or acquisition once or maybe twice during their lives. In some cases, they are selling the company they
          started as part of a succession or exit plan. In other cases, market changes require the disposition of a subsidiary, consolidation to leverage efficiencies and increase value, or to propel an organization into a new market/industry
          segment. Whatever the reason driving the transaction, mergers, acquisitions, and dispositions can be complex and require direction and guidance that extends far beyond the actual transaction.
          </br></br>
          To ensure the best outcome, it’s critical to partner with a firm that understands the various factors that make a successful transaction. For this reason, many Seattle business owners turn to Accuracy to guide them through the
          sale, acquisition, disposition or merger of their company. Our team of seasoned professionals not only have years of experience planning for and conducting these transactions, but they are intimately familiar with the Seattle marketplace
